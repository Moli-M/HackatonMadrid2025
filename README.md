# 🌍 Innovanet – Decentralized Investment in Real-World Projects

## 🧩 Overview

**Innovanet** is a platform that democratizes access to exclusive investments through blockchain, allowing small investors to participate in projects that were previously reserved for banks and large funds.

Through an iterative process of **voting**, **validation**, and **continuous improvement**, each project evolves with community support, while its documentation and data are enriched to ensure transparency and investor confidence.
